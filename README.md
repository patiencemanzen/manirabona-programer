## About
Software Developer, who is interested and passionate about creating quality applications powered by PHP - laravel and Javascript - vue.js, and Never tired of learning, thinking, creating, and building, I've been collaborating and contributing to a diverse range of projects, Teams, and companies to develop their products from ideas up to Marketplace if I don't forget open source projects from health-related to fintech, and now at the Rwanda Build Program as a backend developer.

When am not working on technology, Patience loves watching documentaries, reading and writing books, traveling and exploring, history and psychology, Photograph, Painting, Playing Piano, and enjoys hanging out with devs But Mountains are better!

```PHP
/**
 * Rule-1: No one but ourselves can create ourselves
 *
 * @param Person person
 * @return LifeBuilder
 */
final protected function life(Person $person) {
    return new LifeBuilder($person->whoami());
}
```

I often thought of Steve Jobs’ reality distortion field: when you believe in something so strongly and keep on pushing it so persistently, somehow you can make the impossible possible. and Ideas in different topics or fields can often inspire new ideas and broaden the potential solution space.
